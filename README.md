<p align="center">As simple to configure as <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts" target="_blank">OpenAI's custom GPTs</a>, but deployable in your own cloud infrastructure using Docker. Built using <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index">LlamaIndex</a>.</p>

## Get Started

To run, start a docker container with our image:

```shell
docker run -p 8000:8000 ragapp/ragapp
```

Then, access the Admin UI at http://localhost:8000/admin to configure your RAGapp.

You can use hosted AI models from OpenAI or Gemini, and local models using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

> _Note_: To avoid [running into any errors](https://github.com/ragapp/ragapp/issues/22), we recommend using the latest version of Docker and (if needed) Docker Compose.

## Endpoints

The docker container exposes the following endpoints:

- Admin UI: http://localhost:8000/admin
- Chat UI: http://localhost:8000
- API: http://localhost:8000/docs

> _Note_: The Chat UI and API are only functional if the RAGapp is configured.

## Security

### Authentication

Just the RAGapp container doesn't come with any authentication layer by design. This is the task
of an API Gateway routing the traffic to RAGapp.
This step heavily depends on your cloud provider and the services you use.
For a pure Docker Compose environment, you can look at our [RAGapp with management UI](deploymentsultiple-ragapps) deployment.

### Authorization

Later versions of RAGapp will support restricting access based on access tokens forwarded from an API Gateway or similar.

## Deployment

### Using Docker Compose

You can easily deploy RAGapp to your own infrastructure with one of these Docker Compose deployments:

1. [RAGapp with Ollama and Qdrant](deploymentsingle)
2. [Multiple RAGapps with a management UI](deploymentsultiple-ragapps)

### Kubernetes

It's easy to deploy RAGapp in your own cloud infrastructure. Customized K8S deployment descriptors are coming soon.

## Development

### RAGApp:

Move to [src/ragapp](src/ragapp) directory and start with these commands:

```shell
export ENVIRONMENT=dev
poetry install --no-root
make build-frontends
make dev
```

Then, to check out the admin UI, go to http://localhost:3000/admin.

> _Note_: Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

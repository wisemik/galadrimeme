Ideas for attestation:
1. The claim of a MemeCoin issuer that the character, image, and other related stuff are not tending to harm someone
-- Then we read that statement made by user and attest it
2. A user acts as a attester approving that our service is not responsible for any financial losses caused by a MemeCoin issuance
3. Our platform acts as a rating system - each individual can attest the core concepts of a Memecoin. The more attestations have been made the more reliable coin is.
4. We attest that person's wallet address is a valid address
5. We attest the date the coin issued, the fact that the person made a request for MemeCoin issuance is not a robot
6. Attest user's experience in blockchain industry (person provides short description, we read it and attest)
7. Have to collect N attestation of the idea before coin issuance
